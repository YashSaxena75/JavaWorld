<center><h2 style="color:#66FF33">int vs Integer</h2></center>

we all are quite familiar with int data type , it is a primitive data type that we have used in different languages like , C C++ Java etc.
we have used int for different operations , especially when we start with a program to add two numbers , right ? but we haven't used
"Integer" Data type many times or some of us like me get to know for the very first time. 
let's look at a simple program

```
public class hello{
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
      int a = 8;
      Integer b = 8;
      
      System.out.println(a);
      System.out.println(b);
  }
}

```

this program will print 8 both the times , so what's the difference between these two and which one should I use ? well , it depends on the 
problem scenario , you can use "int" wherever  you want to use , but "int" is a primitive data type and we can't perform much operation on it
where as "Integer" is a wrapper class which provides us some extra functions to help us more while coding , let's see how

```
	static void ex1() {
		
		int a[] = {1,3,4,2};
		int b[] = {1,2,5};
		
		int el = 2;
		int flag = 0 ;
		

		**`for(int i=0;i<3;i++)
		{
			for(int j=0;j<4;j++)
			{
				if(b[i]==a[j])
					flag = flag + 1;
			}
		}`**
		if(flag==3)
			System.out.println("all elements are present");
		else
			System.out.println("1 or more than element is missing");
		
	}
```
